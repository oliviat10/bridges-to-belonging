# Bridges to Belonging: A PGH Co-DeZINE Project
## https://oliviat10.github.io/bridges-to-belonging/

This project was the culmination of Ange Pho & Olivia Terry's Interactive Design senior capstone at the University of Pittsburgh. 
The two of us set out to explore community-driven design methods, united by a shared passion for fostering connections through creative processes. 
The project began with a community zine-making workshop focused on addressing the loneliness epidemic and the decline of third places in Pittsburgh. 
Zines—self-published, DIY booklets—served as a unique form of ethnographic research through which participants could creatively share their 
stories, ideas, and experiences. Through participatory co-design, we identified a shared desire for a digital zine library to amplify the community's 
voices and stories.
